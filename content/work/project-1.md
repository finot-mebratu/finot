![Protection Wear For 'Gulit' Merchants](img/work/project-1/img1.jpg)

In Ethiopia Gulit merchants are small fruit and vegitable sellers who spend all of there work time outside. Due to the nature of their work, this people suffer from the hottness of the sun to the coldest time of the day. Rain is also creates another struggle for this people. In this design, I have created a dust, water proof protection wear with a pocket attachment in order to help them throughout there day to day activites.
